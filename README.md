# Solving Challenge Problems with Python
Repository of scripts written to solve individual challenge problems.

## Purpose
Like chess tactics training, I believe I can improve my coding skillset by solving challenge practice problems to:
- Familiarize myself with common patterns in software problems and develop a toolkit of approaches to solve them
- Practice defining a problem, conceptualizing its challenges, structuring a solution, and implementing it in code
- Hone ability to review code, interpret Big O cost, and identify and implement opportunities for optimization
- Train my aptitude for algorithmic design and my ability to program solutions to new problems in general
