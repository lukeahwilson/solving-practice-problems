# Solving Challenge Problems with Python Repository
Repository of scripts written to solve individual challenge problems.

# Purpose
Like chess tactics training, I believe that solving challenge practice problems will improve my coding skillset by:
- Familiarizing myself with common patterns in software problems and developing a toolkit of approaches to solving them
- Practicing defining a problem, conceptualizing its challenges, structuring a solution, and implementing it in code
- Honing ability to review code, interpret Big O cost, and identify and implement opportunities for optimization
- Training my aptitude for algorithmic design and programming solutions to new problems in general
